2048        Not passive (can be holstered)
4096        Can be used by classes other than Spy (and therefore, has a primary weapon, which can have a reduced ammo capacity)

2147483648  Stickybomb launcher only (charge rate)








1           Grenade launcher only (bounce and roll)

16384       Diamondback only (crits on stab & sap is bugged on other revolvers)

262144      Cleaner's Carbine only (crikey modifiers)
524288      Airblast (split from 131072 'creates fire particles', thanks to the phlog and dragon's fury having each respectively)
